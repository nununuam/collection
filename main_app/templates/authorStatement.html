    <p></br>"The Buttons" expereince is an archival space for me to express a thought. The idea is that we, as indivisual human being expereinces the world through our own archive; set of ideas, values, perspectivs and morals. This in turn, shape the way in which one expereinces the world, the stories you tell and how you tell it. In this experience, The Buttons, I hope to share the things that shape different people perspectives. I will dive into different topics, pieces of works, and events from the begining of pandemic to now. The intention of "The Buttons" is to open indivisual perspectives on how one expereince the world, in turn, how one expereince history (the past). History is often told through archives and so I will be sharing different moment(s) from the pandemic through the chosen of my archival expereince. There is no need to take anything away or feel the pressure do more or less, but rather just expereince "The Buttons" as you feel and see fit.</br>

    Inspiration for this comes from a few sources. The first source comes from Frye Museum. Frye Museum as is all museum is a space for archives and archival pieces to be on display. I took the idea of how museum is a space for archives and created a digital space for it. "The Buttons" could be considered a collection display at a museum for exibition, but instead it is a collection I curated for the digital space. Meseum curates the parts and ways in which history is being told through the pieces the museum collects and display. I am doing the same thing by picking the pieces displayed in "The Buttons". The second inspiration comes from the work by Philip called "Zong!". "Zong!" is a book of poems. The specific inspiration from the book is on how the peorm exist as it is, rather then trying to say something. The words are scatter across the pages and the peoms struture are untraditional. "Zong!" comes from an archive of small bits and pieces. It is just there to experience. Just like "Zong!", "The Buttons" is just there to experience and the different buttons to click are scatter across the webpage. The last great inspiration comes from "The Indigenous Walking Tour" for University of Washington by Owen Oliver. This tour allows people to experience the tour not in a linear timeline, but rather experiencing it through places. Pulling from this idea that you can tell narratives through places instead of time, I am not creating a linear narrative where one has to follow in a particular order. In "The Buttons", you are able to pick which button you want to expereince first.</br>
