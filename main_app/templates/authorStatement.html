    <p>"The Digital Collection: The Chosen" is an archival space for me to express a thought. 
        Archives as we know of are places where historical documents and public records are kept. They contain materials that are archival which, "are information objects that serve as evidence of the past events" (Peter  Van Garderen). Digital Archives are similar to archives but instead of physical archives, the historical objects that provide evidence of the past are digitized often by scanning or photography and so on. In the day of the internet, virtually everything is digitized. Let’s examine how we get our information. The Newspaper. Newspapers have existed since ancient time as a way to share historic current events, in which it is preserving the current events by narrating as a dose of news. With innovations such as the printing press and changes to the Bill of Rights (Freedom of press) newspaper became a form of mass media. Newspapers as a way to archive historical current events slowly shifted with the development of the internet. As the internet became more accessible, the ways to archive and share current events changed. For more on the history of newspaper, check out <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/mediaandculture/chapter/4-2-history-of-newspapers/">”4.2 History of Newspapers“</a>. The chart by <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18827/united-states-newspaper-circulation/">“Then & Now Newspaper Circulation”</a> shows that the Sunday newspaper circulation went from 62 millions in 1993 to 30 million in 2018. This circulation is due to the accessibility that has risen from other forms of mass media and the rise of innovative technologies like Google. In the day of the internet, virtually everything is digitized.  Digitizing through the internet is happening at a more rapid pace as technology grows.

[Growth Charts & Statistics] 2022”</a>. As we can see, the more technology advances, the ways in which we get information changes. </br></br>
        
        As we are familiar with the big tech giant that is Google. If we search something on Google, there are millions of results that will show up, but only a certain selection will be the one that will be on top of the search list. The reason is because of how this information is archived and picked. In the case of Google and many tech giants, the selected ones that will show are picked by algorithm. These algorithms are designed by a group of people. This brings in the question of Who decides what information is at the top of the search? Better yet, is this a way of archiving them? Then what is not being presented? With all these questions asked, it brings up more questions about what information is prioritized and is presented to the mass audiences. In this sense, the internet acts as the production of history. The Internet is a production of history, just like how museums are a production of history. What part of history is being silent in the process of allocating space for specific events? This asks a lot of questions about the space of archival in the digital world. The internet is a massive archive of information through time.

        I am creating a digital archive of the internet. From an existing Massive digital archive (The Internet) to a personalized digital archive by choosing the information I present. The project is a collection of videos and  images from the internet  and of the internet that I have selected to create a small digital archive of my experience of on-going pandemic from my viewpoint. These selection pieces are limited to my perspective and  to the kind/form of narrative I am telling. I am mimicking the process of creating an archive. Archives tell the stories of the past, create the narrative of the present moment and frame the future. In this project I am exploring these central questions to act as a guide. The first question is, why are archives limited to the creator(s) perspective(s)? To answer this question from where I am now, I believe it is due to the amount of information we have. With the mass of information we have collected through the years, it is my belief that it is impossible for us to collect everything that is happening and share it all with equal exposure. The second question is, who gets to tell the stories of the past? Simple answer is anyone. The last question that is broader is, how does the real world preserve its history in the digital world?  (vice versa) How does the digital world preserve its history in the real world? These questions are what I ponder upon as I try to create a small personalized archive.

        Inspiration for this work:
        Inspiration for this comes from a few sources. The first source comes from Frye Museum. Frye Museum as is all museums is a space for archives and archival pieces to be on display just like the internet. I took the idea of how museum is a space for archives and created a digital space for it. "The Digital Collection" could be considered a collection displayed at a museum for exhibition, but instead it is a collection I curated for the digital space. Museum curates the parts and ways in which history is being told through the pieces the museum collects and displays. Frye museum recently put on Christina Quarles exhibition. Just as the museum curates what they are showcasing, I am curating what I am showcasing as well. The second inspiration comes from the work by Philip called "Zong!". "Zong!" is a book of poems. The specific inspiration from the book is on how the poem exists as it is, rather than trying to say something. The words are scattered across the pages and the poem's structure is untraditional just like an artwork. "Zong!" comes from an archive of a legal document. It is just there to experience. Taking inspiration from "Zong!"I am creating the digital showcasing to just showcase the pieces, rather than curating to make a statement. After working on the project, it is impossible to do this. As I try to be objective and pinpoint certain events, I am faced with the dilemma of trying to pick which event is more important. The  space in which I tried to curate something is the space where I cannot be neutral. The word curate according to <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/curate">Vocabulary.com</a> is when …”you organize and present it.” This in itself is already flawed in that by curating, you are using you as a baseline. In turn the baseline is an entity or entities that exist with its own set of established ways. The last great inspiration comes from "The Indigenous Walking Tour" for University of Washington by Owen Oliver. This tour allows people to experience the tour not in a linear timeline, but rather experiencing it through places. Pulling from this idea that you can tell narratives through places instead of time, I am not creating a linear narrative where one has to follow in a particular order. In the showcasing, I am focusing on just presenting the pieces as individuals work without trying to organize in a certain way. Again, this is impossible. The reason for it is that by creating something on a landing page, you have to set up how the page flows. By setting up which information to put first, you are already organizing it in certain ways.

        Reflection: 
        Through trying to create this project, it pinpoints the complexity of archiving history. The Internet is the production of history, in the process of trying to bring light to certain topics, it silences others. The production of silence exists as the result of my attempt to unsilence different aspects of world events. As I developed this page, I ended up being cripple by this realization. It brought on more questions than answers. This adds to ongoing conversation about what kind of information is dominant on the internet and what information is spread (telling histories). Further questions, should information be regulated? What should be archived? How? Who decides what is an archive? What are we silencing everyday? I will leave it at that. I do not recommend looking at my archive, why? Because it is not what I want for this project. I just want us to start having conversations surrounding these topics and realize how we are silencing different aspects of history.</br>
