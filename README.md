# The Buttons
This is my Senior Thesis. It is an archival of my experiences of the world since the pandemic started. Just as museum has collections, this is my digital archival collection. I believe that these different moments are important part of historic events. How you choose to interpret it and translate it will be solely up to you. It doesn't mean that one need to take anything away from this other then expereincing it.
